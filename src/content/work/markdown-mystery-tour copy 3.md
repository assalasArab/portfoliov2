# Digital: CPU Data Path+ cc RV32 bits

Welcome to the Digital project! This GitHub repository hosts a digital processing unit designed with an optimized data path for executing instructions compatible with the RV32 (RISC-V 32-bit) architecture.

## Introduction
The Digital CPU is aimed at providing an efficient computing solution for various applications. It offers a streamlined data path and supports the RV32 instruction set, making it versatile and adaptable to different computing tasks.

## Features
- Optimized data path for efficient instruction execution
- Compatibility with RV32 (RISC-V 32-bit) architecture
- Suitable for a wide range of computing applications

## Usage
To use the Digital CPU effectively, it's essential to adjust certain delays within the processor based on the program counter (PC). These delays ensure proper synchronization and efficient execution of instructions. Make sure to modify these delays according to the specific requirements of your application.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Digital project are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding new features, optimizing performance, or fixing bugs, feel free to submit pull requests and contribute to the development of this open-source CPU design.
